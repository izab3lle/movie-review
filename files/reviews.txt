Overly long and slow, with too much exposition.
Impressive battle sequences, but some storylines drag a bit.
Overrated and self-indulgent, with more style than substance.
Emotionally manipulative and filled with unrealistic plot points.
Generic revenge story with predictable moments and forgettable characters.
Tries too hard to be profound but ends up feeling pretentious.
A breathtaking start to an epic journey, filled with heart and adventure.
A cinematic triumph, flawlessly acted and beautifully crafted.
Sweet and touching, though at times overly sentimental.
Epic and thrilling, with a powerful performance by Russell Crowe.
Visually stunning, but the plot gets overly complex at times.
